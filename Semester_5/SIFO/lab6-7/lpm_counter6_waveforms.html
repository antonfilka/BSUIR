<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lpm_counter6.vhd" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lpm_counter6.vhd". The design "lpm_counter6.vhd" is a 8 bit up counter. The counter has an asynchronous set signal, that sets the counter to all 1's. </P>
